### 3. Start your Chat
- Once the CAPTCHA is complete, you'll be connected to another user in a peer-to-peer chat session. Type your message and press Enter or click the Send button to send. The conversation will happen in real-time, and you'll see messages instantly.
- To switch to a new chat, simply click the *Next* button. This will end your current conversation and connect you to a new anonymous user, allowing for a smooth transition to the next chat.

## Testing
- If you see *1 online now*, it means you're the only one online. To establish a peer-to-peer connection, at least two users are required. Therefore, open the Chat & Mingle website in two different browsers or on two separate devices.
- Once both browsers are open and the CAPTCHA verification is completed on each, you'll be connected for a peer-to-peer chat session with yourself.
- Else, if there is more than one user online, you will be automatically connected to an anonymous peer for a real-time chat session.
